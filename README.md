# Credit_alerts
Using gmail api

The project was created to calculate the total of my monthly credit card spending so I would know the balance daily. It pulled the totals from my email alerts for spending over 1 dollar and added them together. This was one way I planned to track spending without using a budget app that required giving my bank password away. This project also taught me about the gmail api.
